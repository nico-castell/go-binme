# Go bin-unbin

I've been learning [***Golang***](https://golang.org/) for a while, I made this program to process input into binary, hexadecimal and octal.

Usage:
- To process text input into binary:
    ```shell
    $ go-binme
    ```
- To process text input into hexadecimal:
    ```shell
    $ go-binme -h
    ```
- To process text input into octal:
    ```shell
    $ go-binme -o
    ```
- You can pipe the input:
    ```shell
    $ echo "Hello, World" | go-binme
    ```
